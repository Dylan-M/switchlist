SwitchList automatically generates lists of freight cars to switch on a model railroad, allowing your operators to perform realistic model railroad operations. If you're a Mac user with a small model railroad or a shelf layout and want a switch list program thatâ€™s easy to set up and easy to use, try it out!

Download SwitchList from [SwitchList's home page](http://www.vasonabranch.com/switchlist), or get it from Apple's  [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/switchlist/id550383737?mt=12). Visit our home page for more details about how to use the program.

Look here for the source code for the program, the [https://github.com/bowdidge/switchlist/blob/master/docs/ProjectGoals.wiki](goals of the project), and [https://github.com/bowdidge/switchlist/blob/master/docs/FeatureIdeas.wiki](some of the features we hope to add).
