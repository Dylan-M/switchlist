SwitchList automatically generates lists of freight cars to switch on a model railroad, allowing your operators to perform realistic model railroad operations. If you're a Mac user with a small model railroad or a shelf layout and want a switch list program thatâ€™s easy to set up and easy to use, try it out!

Download SwitchList from [SwitchList's home page](http://www.vasonabranch.com/switchlist). Also, visit the home page for more details about how to use the program.

Look here for the source code for the program, the goals of the project, and some of the features we hope to add.
